Reviewer #1:

1. **Response to comment**: The authors should explain the most important achievements of the proposed method quantitatively, in the abstract.

**Response**: 

We appreciate the reviewer's valuable feedback and have carefully considered their suggestion. In response, we have re-written the relevant content in the abstract to provide a quantitative analysis of the most important achievements of our proposed method.

The revised abstract now highlights that our method not only achieves the same results as the traversal method but also demonstrates significantly improved computational efficiency. Specifically, our method achieves computational efficiency improvements ranging from 3000 to 75000 times, primarily depending on the number of switches involved. This enhancement in computational efficiency is a key advantage of our method.

Furthermore, our method stands out for its ability to accurately calculate the MAC of RBSs with arbitrary configurations, even in scenarios with random isolated batteries. This capability expands the applicability of our method to a wider range of scenarios and enhances its practical utility.

We believe that these quantitative achievements, as described in the revised abstract, effectively demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

2. **Response to comment**: The literature review in the introduction section is very short, and the related works, especially the works published in recent years, have not been well reviewed and compared, and the conclusions about the existing research gaps have not been presented.
