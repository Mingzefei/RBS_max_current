Subject: Request for Extension on Manuscript No. SPACE-D-23-00082R1 - Maximum Allowable Current Determination of RBS By Using a Directed Graph Model and Greedy Algorithm

Dear Editor,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing on behalf of my team regarding our manuscript, “Maximum Allowable Current Determination of RBS By Using a Directed Graph Model and Greedy Algorithm”, with the reference number SPACE-D-23-00082R1.

We have carefully considered and appreciated the insightful comments from the two reviewers. In response to their feedback, we plan to make significant improvements to our manuscript. This includes referencing more recent and relevant literature, specifically including the article mentioned in comment 8 of the first revision. We also aim to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the algorithm more explicitly and add more case studies to validate our works and results. Additionally, we will be engaging professional services to correct and polish our manuscript. 

However, these improvements require a amount of time to ensure that they are executed properly. Therefore, **we kindly request an extension of two weeks to complete these revisions, which would result in a revised submission date of November 19th**. We believe that this additional time will allow us to produce a more substantial and polished manuscript that aligns with the high standards of the Space: Science & Technology journal. We appreciate your understanding and consideration in this matter.

Thank you for your time, and we look forward to your response.

Best regards,

Dr. Cheng Qian, on behalf of all authors
