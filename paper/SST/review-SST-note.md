### 期刊修改意见

In addition to the reviewers' comments on your paper, the assistant editor herein advises that you **improve the general language expression** during revision progress.  Since polishing language itself benefits the overall evaluation of the manuscript, a native speaker could be helpful in further advancing this aspect.

If you decide to revise the work, please submit the following:  
- A cover letter with a list of changes or a rebuttal against each point raised in the review  
- A separate revised manuscript file with highlighted changes  
- Separate high-resolution figure files in editable file format. We prefer vector-based files but can accept the following file types: Adobe Illustrator (AI), Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), Photoshop (PSD), JPEG, PNG, and Tagged Image File Format (TIFF). Please see <a href="https://spj.science.org/pb-assets/SPJ/CustomPages/Misc/SPJ_Figure_Preparation_Guide-1691522222.pdf">our figure guide</a> for assistance in preparing your figures.

Reviewer #1 : The authors present an interesting article on Reconfigurable Battery Systems, however, there are some concerns that should be addressed to improve the quality of the manuscript:  
*    The authors should explain the most important achievements of the proposed method quantitatively, in the abstract.  （修改摘要，量化）
*    The literature review in the introduction section is very short, and the related works, especially the works published in recent years, have not been well reviewed and compared, and the conclusions about the existing research gaps have not been presented.  （介绍，相关文献。RBS结构分析相关的；网络流（最大流）相关，但因为问题不同，无法使用，提一嘴穷举）
*    It is necessary for the authors to clearly state research contribution and achievements as bullet points at the end of the Introduction section.  
*    The authors need to present the complexity of their proposed method and compare it with some other state-of-the-art or successful classic methods.  （算法复杂度搞出来，没有相关研究，无法比较）
*    The authors don't discuss the limitations of the study correctly.  （根据复杂度，大规模不好用）
*    Some typos should be double check.  
*    The author should explain more why solution quality of their proposed approach is much better than the others?  （没有相关研究，无法比较）
*    Authors should mention some novel works in the field in the introduction, specially refer to this 2023 reference: An efficient lightweight algorithm for scheduling tasks onto dynamically reconfigurable hardware using graph-oriented simulated annealing, which uses graph-based method. Mention and refer to it in the introduction section.  （时序上调度优化，和我们的静态结构分析，虽然用了相同的方法，但是不同问题，没有相关性，不引用）
*    Authors need to explain about the accuracy, sufficiency and reliability of their results? How do they verify and validate the results?（和穷举结果进行比较）


和穷举（写个伪代码，放复杂度）比较，准确性、复杂度，开关数量

回复信：先解释我们对问题的理解，
