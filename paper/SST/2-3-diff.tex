\begin{abstract}
Reconfigurable battery systems (RBSs) present a promising alternative to traditional battery systems due to their flexible and dynamically changeable topological structure that can be adapted to different battery charging and discharging strategies.
During RBS operation, a critical system parameter known as the maximum allowable current (MAC) become pivotal. This parameter is instrumental in maintaining the current of each individual battery within a safe range and serves as a guiding indicator for the system's reconfiguration, thereby ensuring its safety and reliability.
%DIF < <*reviewer1-comment1>
This paper proposes a method to calculate the MAC of arbitrary RBSs using a greedy algorithm in conjunction with a directed graph model of the RBS.
By introducing the shortest path \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(SP) }\DIFaddend of the battery, the greedy algorithm transforms the enumeration of switch states in the brute-force algorithm \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{or variable search without utilizing structures in the heuristic algorithms (simulated annealing and genetic algorithm) }\DIFaddend into the combination of the shortest paths\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, which greatly increases }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.
This significantly enhances }\DIFaddend the efficiency with which the MAC is determined.
The directed graph model, based on the equivalent circuit, provides a specific method for calculating the MAC of a given structure.
The proposed method is validated on two published \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{four-battery-RBSs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{RBS structures }\DIFaddend and one with a more complex structure.
The results are the same as those of the brute-force algorithm, but the proposed method significantly improves the computational efficiency ($N_s 2^{N_s - N_b} \log_{10} N_b$ times faster than the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{brute force }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{brute-force }\DIFaddend algorithm for an RBS with $N_b$ batteries and $N_s$ switches, theoretically).
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The main }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Another }\DIFaddend advantage of the proposed method is its ability to calculate the MAC of RBSs with arbitrary structures \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and variable battries}\DIFaddend , even in scenarios with random isolated batteries.

\DIFdelend \section{Introduction}

Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{extensively used }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{widely utilized }\DIFaddend in various applications \cite{yangBatteryEnergyStorage2018}, such as wind power plants \cite{desiqueiraControlStrategySmooth2021} and space power systems \cite{schwanbeckInternationalSpaceStation2019,zhangDevelopmentProspectChinese2021}, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to store and release }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for the purpose of storing and releasing }\DIFaddend high-quality electrical energy \cite{choCommercialResearchBattery2015}.
Typically, a BESS consists of numerous batteries interconnected by series-parallel circuitry to provide the required \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{capacity storage }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{storage capacity}\DIFaddend .
However, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{traditional }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{conventional }\DIFaddend BESSs, in which the batteries are connected in a fixed topology, suffer from a significant weakness in their worst battery due to the so-called cask effect.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Moreover}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Furthermore}\DIFaddend , if the worst battery fails during operation, it is highly likely to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{exacerbate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{accelerate }\DIFaddend the degradation of the other batteries, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{leading to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{resulting in }\DIFaddend reliability and safety issues \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{at the system level }\DIFaddend \cite{yangUnbalancedDischargingAging2016,fengPropagationMechanismsDiagnosis2019,jeevarajanBatterySafetyQualifications2012}.
These \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{problems have become significant technical barriers }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{challenges have become major technical obstacles }\DIFaddend in many engineering projects \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{requiring }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that demand }\DIFaddend high reliability, such as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{developing new-generation }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the development of next-generation }\DIFaddend space vehicles \cite{pomboHybridPowerSystem2021}.
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD <

\DIFdelend Reconfigurable battery systems (RBSs), which can dynamically switch \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as required to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{between }\DIFaddend different circuit topologies \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as needed}\DIFaddend , are expected to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{solve this problem \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{hanNextGenerationBatteryManagement2020a}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
The switching circuit helps to isolate unhealthy batteries, thereby improving the safety and reliability of the battery system.
To illustrate the working principle of an RBS, we consider }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{address these issues \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{hanNextGenerationBatteryManagement2020a}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
In }\DIFaddend a typical RBS\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{structure developed by Visairo \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{visairoReconfigurableBatteryPack2008} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
(Fig. \ref{fig:stru-Visairo}), which is taken as an example to show the reconfiguration process.
In this structure, the batteries can be connected not only in series when the switches$S_1$}\DIFdelend , \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$S_5$, $S_6$, $S_7$, $S_8$, $S_9$, and $S_{13}$ are closed (see Fig.
\ref{fig:stru-Visairo-serial}) but also in parallel when $S_1$, $S_2$, $S_3$, $S_4$, $S_5$, $S_9$, $S_{10}$, $S_{11}$, $S_{12}$, and $S_{13}$ are closed (Fig. \ref{fig:stru-Visairo-parallel}).
Furthermore, when an unhealthy battery, for instance, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{additional switches are introduced between the batteries to form a reconfigurable network, where the circuit's topology can be altered by opening or closing the switches.
By opening the switches adjacent to the unhealthy batteries, they can be isolated from the system, ensuring that the system remains in a reliable operational state \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{ci2016reconfigurable}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
Furthermore, }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{orange one $B_3$ in Fig.
\ref{fig:stru-Visairo-isolate}, appears in the RBS , it can be isolated by opening its two adjacent switches (i.e., $S_4$ and $S_{11}$), ensuring that the systemremains in a reliable working mode}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{RBS can be reconfigured to adapt to different charging and discharging strategies, thereby enhancing the system's efficiency and prolonging the battery's lifespan \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

.
These advantages make RBSs a promising alternative to traditional BESSs}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdel{Recently, various types of RBSs with different }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The early research on RBSs mainly focused on the topological design of the structure, incorporating different levels of }\DIFaddend flexibility and reconfigurability \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{have been designed }\DIFdelend to meet application requirements.
For example, Ci et al. \cite{ci2007novel} proposed an RBS structure that dynamically adjusts the battery discharge rate to fully exploit the available capacity of each battery. 
Jan's \cite{9209774,engelhardt2021double} structures reconfigure \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{structures }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{circuits }\DIFaddend with variant batteries in series to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{reach the (constantly changing ) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{accommodate the constantly changing }\DIFaddend voltage requirements during electric vehicle charging.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:stru-Visairo}, the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend structure proposed by Visairo et al. \cite{visairoReconfigurableBatteryPack2008} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{changes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{alters }\DIFaddend the system's output voltage based on the load conditions, thereby reducing \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the power loss of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{power loss in }\DIFaddend the voltage regulator during the power supply process and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{improving the efficiency of energy use}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{enhancing energy efficiency}\DIFaddend . 
Also, to enhance the energy efficiency of the system, Lawson et al. \cite{lawsonSoftwareConfigurableBattery2012} and He et al. \cite{he2014reconfiguration}  proposed simplified structures that have fewer switches than Visairo's design.
Kim et al. \cite{kim2009dynamic} improved the system's ability to recover from battery failures by introducing multiple ports into the structure.

\DIFdel{The complex structure }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{However, these complex structures }\DIFaddend between batteries and switches \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{gives RBSs flexibility but also creates challenges in the designand control of the system . 
Thus, several approaches to analyze the RBS structure and performance have been proposed to tackle these challenges. 
For instance, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{provide flexibility to RBSs while also posing challenges in hardware design. 
During the reconfiguration process, current deviation and fluctuation may occur. Specifically, when the system switches from series to parallel connection, circulating current between parallel cells can be triggered due to voltage imbalance \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{hanAnalysisEstimationMaximum2020}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
. Failure to fully consider this issue during the design of RBSs can result in damage to the batteries, switches, and wires. 
For example, Engelhardt et al. \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{engelhardtDoubleStringBatterySystem2021} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
applied RBS to a fast-charging scenario with adaptive cell switching, which can balance cell states while adhering to voltage requests. However, the switching of batteries leads to intolerable current variations. 
To address this problem, }\DIFaddend Han et al. \cite{han2021analysis} derived an analytical expression for the maximum switch current during battery system reconfiguration\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for a specific RBS structure. This helps guide }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. This analytical expression aids in }\DIFaddend the selection of switches and supports the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{design of RBS hardware. 
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{hardware design of RBSs.
}


\DIFadd{Recently, there has been increasing attention given to the estimation and control of the system state of RBSs, and several approaches have been proposed to optimize the performance of the system. 
State estimation, which is an essential technology in traditional battery management systems, serves as the foundation for system control and holds great potential in the context of RBSs \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{komsiyskaCriticalReviewIntelligent2021}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
Couto et al. \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{coutoPartitionbasedUnscentedKalman2018a} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
introduced a partition-based unscented Kalman filter to estimate the state of a large-scale RBS, utilizing an enhanced reduced-order electrochemical model. 
Kersten et al. \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{kerstenOnlineOnBoardBattery2020a} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
utilized the balancing current of neighboring cells in parallel operation to determine battery impedances, thereby obtaining information about the state of health and power capability. 
Schmid et al. \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{schmidActiveModelBasedFault2021a} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
further leveraged the reconfigurable nature of the system to actively diagnose faults, employing an algorithm that changes the system structure to enhance fault isolability. 
Another active research topic is the development of effective control strategies for RBSs to achieve optimal performance, including improved stability \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{kacetlDesignAnalysisModular2023b} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
and efficiency \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{yangAdaptiveControlFramework2022}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
Han et al. \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{hanNearFastestBatteryBalancing2019a} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
proposed a near-fastest battery balancing algorithm to minimize the time required for battery charge equalization.
Liu et al. \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{liuFlexiblePathPlanningbased2023a} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
also proposed a scheme for maximizing capacity utilization based on a path planning algorithm, aiming to enhance battery consistency within the system.
To break through the bootleneck of the potential short-circuit paths increase exponentially with the RBS's scale, }\DIFaddend Chen et al. \cite{chenSneakCircuitTheory2021} proposed a systematic approach based on sneak circuit theory\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to fundamentally avoid the short-circuit problem of RBSs:

They conducted a comprehensive analysis of }\DIFaddend all paths between the cathode and anode of each battery in the RBS\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and identified }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, identifying }\DIFaddend paths that only \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{contain }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{consist of }\DIFaddend switches as short-circuit paths for pre-checking before system reconfiguration.

\section{Methodology}

The central principle of this method is to connect the batteries in an RBS in parallel to the extent possible, thereby maximizing the output current of the RBS.
To achieve this universally and automatically, the overall process is divided into the four steps shown in Fig. \ref{fig:main}.
First, a directed graph model is established for subsequent computations. The model not only contains the connected relationships between batteries and switches but also retains the performance parameters of the batteries.
Subsequently, based on the equivalent circuit, the MAC problem is transformed into specific objective functions and constraints.
The shortest paths (SPs, where additional batteries and switches on the path are penalized as distance) for the batteries are then obtained  by using the Dijkstra algorithm to connect the batteries in the RBS in parallel.
Finally, a greedy algorithm is used to organize the switches, allowing the batteries to connect via their SPs while satisfying the constraints, resulting in the MAC of the RBS.

He et al. \cite{heExploringAdaptiveReconfiguration2013} proposed an abstracted directed graph model for an RBS, where the nodes represent the batteries, the edges represent the configuration flexibility, and the weight of each vertex corresponds to the battery voltage (Fig. \ref{fig:direct-graph-he}). 
The model captures all potential system configurations and offers a direct metric for configuration flexibility, but it does not specify the physical implementation of the connectivity between batteries, meaning that one graph might correspond to multiple RBS structures.
We previously proposed a directed graph model that differs completely from He's model by using nodes to represent the connections between batteries and switches and directed edges to represent batteries and switches (Fig. \ref{fig:direct-graph-xu}), allowing for a one-to-one correspondence between the RBS structure and the directed graph model. 
This model accurately and comprehensively represents the RBS topological structure but cannot be used for quantitative MAC calculations because it does not consider  the voltage, internal resistance, and MAC of the battery. 
To address this issue, we improve our previous model by adding electromotive force and resistance attributes on the edges based on its equivalent circuits.
The model also considers the external load as an equivalent resistance and integrates it into the analysis, making it a complete circuit model for later circuit analyses.
Fig. \ref{fig:direct-graph-my} shows the improved directed graph model used in this paper.
The following  provides a detailed explanation of the method for equating components in RBSs and constructing the directed graph model.


To use circuit analysis methods to solve the MAC of the RBS, the components in the RBS are equated to ideal circuit elements.
For instance, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:battery_simple}, the battery in the RBS is represented as a black-box circuit consisting of two resistors $r_1$ and $r_2$ and a capacitor $C$, known as the Thevenin model \cite{hongwenheStateofChargeEstimationLithiumIon2011,mousavig.VariousBatteryModels2014}.
With an emphasis on the stable output of the RBS, the capacitor in the Thevenin model can be considered as an open circuit without affecting the steady-state current.
Therefore,  battery $B_i$ in the RBS can be simplified as a series connection between a constant voltage source $u_{i}$ and a resistor $r_{i}$.
Furthermore, the state of switch $S_j$ in the RBS is represented by a binary variable $x_j$, where 0 is ON and 1 is OFF.
When the switch is closed, the circuit can be regarded as a resistor with a very small resistance $r_{j}$.
Finally, the external load is considered as a resistor with resistance $R_o$.


For a given RBS structure, its directed graph model $G(V,E)$ is constructed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Nodes:
        The nodes in the directed graph correspond to the connection points of components in the actual RBS. 
        Assuming there are a total of $N$ nodes in the RBS, for the sake of convenience, the anode of the RBS is denoted as $v_1$ and the cathode as $v_N$.
    \item Edges:
        The edges in the directed graph correspond to the batteries, switches, and external electrical loads in the actual RBS.
        Therefore, there are three types of directed edges. 
        For battery $B_i$, its directed edge $e_i$ is drawn from the cathode to the anode because the battery in operation only allows current to flow in one direction.
        For switch $S_j$, since it is allowed to work under bidirectional currents, it is represented by a pair of directed edges with two-way directions. 
        Regarding the external electronic load, because it is connected to the anode and cathode of the RBS, a directed edge from $v_N$ to $v_1$  represents it. 
        In conclusion, for a given RBS structure with $N_b$ batteries and $N_s$ switches, the number of directed edges is $N_b+2N_s+1$, where 1 refers to the external electrical load.
    \item Attributes of edges:
        Each edge is assigned two attributes, voltage difference and resistance, based on the equivalent method mentioned above.
        The values for  battery $B_i$, switch $S_j$, and external loads correspond to $(u_i, r_i)$, $(0, r_j)$, and $(0, R_o)$, respectively.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Constraints and objective function}

For a given RBS, determining its MAC involves maximizing the RBS output current while ensuring that all battery currents do not exceed the batteries' MAC. 
This subsection establishes the constraints and objective function to determine the RBS's MAC through circuit analysis based on the directed graph model provided in the previous section.


First, the topology in the directed graph model is represented in matrix form $\bm{A}$, known as the incidence matrix and defined as follows:
\begin{align}\label{eq:A}
    a_{kl}=
    \begin{cases}
        1,  & \text{edge $l$ leaves node $k$},\\
        -1, & \text{edge $l$ enters node $k$},\\
        0,  & \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
\end{align}
For a directed graph consisting of $N$ nodes and $N_b+2N_s+1$ directed edges, its incidence matrix $\bm{A}$ is an $N\times(N_b+2N_s+1)$ matrix. 
In this matrix, the rows and columns represent the nodes and edges of the directed graph, respectively.
By distinguishing the components in the RBS corresponding to each column, $\bm{A}$ can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:A_bso}
    \bm{A} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \bm{A}_b & \bm{A}_s & \bm{A}_o
    \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
where $\bm{A}_b$, $\bm{A}_s$, and $\bm{A}_o$ are the submatrices corresponding to the batteries, switches, and external electrical load, respectively.
To reduce the computational complexity, the dimensions of matrix $\bm{A}$ are reduced.
Since each directed edge has one node to leave and one to enter, the values in every column of $\bm{A}$ sum to zero.
Therefore, removing the last row will not result in a loss of information. 
Conversely, since each switch in the RBS is represented by a pair of directed edges with two-way directions, the two columns corresponding to the switch are mutually opposite.
Thus, for the submatrix $\bm{A}_s$, only one column is retained for each pair of columns representing the same switch.
As a result, $\bm{A}$ can be reduced to an $(N-1)\times(N_b+N_s+1)$ matrix, denoted  $\bm{\tilde{A}}$, for further calculation of current and voltage.
Similar to Eq. (\ref{eq:A_bso}), $\bm{\tilde{A}}$ can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:A_bso_tilde}
    \bm{\tilde{A}} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \bm{\tilde{A}}_b & \bm{\tilde{A}}_s & \bm{\tilde{A}}_o
    \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}


After obtaining the incidence matrix, the currents of all batteries and output in the RBS are determined by solving the circuit equations.
According to Kirchhoff's laws, we have
\begin{align}\label{eq:Kirchhoffs_law}
    \begin{cases}
        \bm{\tilde{A}} \bm{I} = \bm{0}, \\
        \bm{U}        = \bm{\tilde{A}}^\T \bm{U}_n,
    \end{cases}
\end{align}
where $\bm{I}$ and $\bm{U}$ indicate the current and voltage difference arrays of the $N_b+N_s+1$ edges, respectively, and
$\bm{U}_n$ is the voltage array of the $N-1$ nodes.
These directed edges are treated as generalized branches and expressed in matrix form as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:generalized_branches}
    \bm{I} = \bm{Y}\bm{X} \bm{U} - \bm{Y}\bm{X} \bm{U}_s +\bm{I}_s,
\end{equation}
where $\bm{U}_s$ and $\bm{I}_s$ denote the source voltage and source current of the generalized branches, respectively.
Because all batteries have been equivalent to voltage sources rather than current sources in the previous subsection, all elements of the array $\bm{I}_s$ are zero, 
whereas the elements of the array $\bm{U}_s$ are equal to the first attribute of the corresponding edges in the directed graph.
The matrix $\bm{Y}$ in Eq. (\ref{eq:generalized_branches}) is the admittance matrix of the circuit and is defined as the inverse of the impedance matrix.
The elements on the diagonal of matrix $\bm{Y}$ are equal to the reciprocal of the resistance, which is the second attribute of the corresponding edges in the directed graph. The off-diagonal elements of $\bm{Y}$ are zero.
$\bm{X}$ is the state matrix that determines whether the RBS batteries and switches can pass current.
It is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:X}
    \bm{X} = \diag(
    \underbrace{1, 0, \dots, 1}_{N_b~\text{of}~0/1},
    \underbrace{1, 0, \dots, 1}_{N_s~\text{of}~0/1},
    1)
    =\begin{bmatrix}
        \bm{X}_b & & \\
        & \bm{X}_s &\\
        & & 1
    \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
where element $x_i$ of matrix $\bm{X}_b$ indicates whether battery $B_i$ has been removed from the circuit, with $x_i=1$ indicating removal and $x_i=0$ indicating that battery $B_i$ is still available to supply power. 
When all batteries are healthy and capable of providing current to the external load, $\bm{X}_b$ is the identity matrix. 
The elements $x_j$ of  matrix $\bm{X}_s$ determine whether switch $S_j$ is closed, with $x_j=1$ indicating a closed switch and $x_j=0$ indicating an open switch, which is consistent with the previous subsection.


Theoretically, the output current $I_o$ and the currents of each battery $\bm{I}_b$ in the RBS  can be determined by solving Eqs. (\ref{eq:Kirchhoffs_law})--(\ref{eq:X}) under any given state $\bm{X}$.
To further simplify the problem, it is assumed that all batteries have the same electromotive force and internal resistance, which are denoted $u_b$ and $r_b$, respectively.
This allows us to derive explicit expressions for $I_o$ and $\bm{I}_b$.
After derivation and simplification, the output current $I_o$ and the currents of each battery $\bm{I}_b$ are ultimately represented as Eqs. (\ref{eq:I_o}) and (\ref{eq:I_b}), respectively:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:I_o}
    I_o = \frac{1}{R_o r_b} \bm{\tilde{A}}_o^\T \bm{Y}_n^{-1}(\bm{X}) \bm{\tilde{A}}_b \bm{U}_b,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:I_b}
    \bm{I}_b = \frac{1}{r_b^2}[\bm{\tilde{A}}_b^\T \bm{Y}_n^{-1}(\bm{X}) \bm{\tilde{A}}_b\bm{U}_b -r_b \bm{U}_b],
\end{equation}
where $\bm{U}_b$ is an $N_b\times 1$ array with all elements equal to $u_b$,
and $\bm{Y}_n$ is the equivalent admittance matrix of the circuit and is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Yn}
    \bm{Y}_n (\bm{X}) = \frac{1}{R_o} \bm{\tilde{A}}_o\bm{\tilde{A}}_o^\T + \frac{1}{r_b} \bm{\tilde{A}}_b\bm{X}_b\bm{\tilde{A}}_b^\T + \frac{1}{r_s}\bm{\tilde{A}}_s\bm{X}_s\bm{\tilde{A}}_s^\T.
\end{equation}


To characterize the current output capacity of the RBS structure under different switching states, an indicator $\eta$ is defined by the ratio of $I_o$ to $\max (\bm{I}_b)$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eta}
    \eta = \frac{I_o}{\max (\bm{I}_b)}.
\end{equation}
Finally the problem of finding the MAC can be formulated as
\begin{align}
    & \max \eta(\bm{X}_s) \label{eq:max_eta}\\
    \text{s.t. } & \max (\bm{I}_b) \leq I_m, \label{eq:Ib_leq_Im}
\end{align}
where $I_m$ is the MAC of the battery.


However, it remains computationally difficult to solve Eq. (\ref{eq:max_eta}) because of $\bm{Y}_n^{-1}$.
On one hand,  the introduction of nonlinear terms by $\bm{Y}_n^{-1}$ renders many  methods in linear optimization unsuitable for this problem.
On the other hand, the rank of $Y_{n}$ is proportional to the number of batteries and switches, which can be very large for a large RBS, leading to a significant computational burden.
As a result, intelligent algorithms that rely on evolution by iteration may face efficiency problems when dealing with a large RBS.
To address this issue, the problem should be considered from the perspective of guiding the RBS to reconstruct as many parallel structures as possible.
Consequently, a greedy algorithm based on the shortest path is proposed. 
The detailed implementation of this algorithm is presented in the following two subsections.

\subsection{Shortest path}

The path $p$ used in this method is defined as the complete route that passes through one battery (or a consecutive series of batteries) and closed switches, connecting the anode $v_1$ to the cathode $v_N$ of the RBS.
By applying a penalty to the series-connected batteries on the path, where additional batteries imply a greater distance, the algorithm encourages the RBS to form parallel structures to the extent possible.
In addition, to reduce the number of switches controlled during the reconstruction process, a penalty is also applied to the total number of switches on the path while ensuring the minimum number of batteries.
Therefore, the distance $\omega$ of path $p$ is  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:weight}
    \omega(p) = N_s  n_b (p) + n_s (p),
\end{equation}
where $N_s$ is the total number of switches in the system, 
and $n_b(p)$ and $n_s(p)$ are number of batteries and switches in path $p$, respectively. 
Moreover, the shortest path $SP_i$ is defined as the path with the minimum $\omega$ for battery $B_i$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:def_sp}
    SP_i = \mathop{\arg\min}_{p \in P_i} \omega(p),
\end{equation}
where $P_i$ is the set of all paths from $v_1$ to $v_N$ that pass through directed edge $i$.


$SP_i$ can be solved by the Dijkstra algorithm.
The Dijkstra algorithm is a graph-search method that finds the shortest path between two given nodes in a weighted graph, efficiently solving the single-source shortest-path problem.
Denoting the cathode and anode of battery $B_i$ as $v_i^-$ and $v_i^+$ respectively, then path $p$ of battery $B_i$  can be divided into three segments: $v_1 \rightarrow v_i^-$, $v_i^+ \rightarrow v_N$, and $v_i^- \rightarrow v_i^+$. $v_i^- \rightarrow v_i^+$ is the directed edge corresponding to battery $B_i$. 
With the Dijkstra algorithm, shortest paths for $v_1 \rightarrow v_i^-$ and $v_i^+ \rightarrow v_N$ can be calculated under the weights given in Eq. (\ref{eq:weight}) and denoted $SP(v_i^- \rightarrow v_i^+)$ and $SP(v_i^+ \rightarrow v_N)$, respectively.
Finally, $SP_i$ for battery $B_i$ is formed by the complete path, which consists of $SP(v_1 \rightarrow v_i^-)$, $v_i^- \rightarrow v_i^+$, and $SP(v_i^+ \rightarrow v_N)$.

\subsection{Greedy algorithm}\label{subsec:greedy_solution}

From the perspective of series vs parallel connections, integrating more batteries into the circuit through their shortest paths (SPs) results in more batteries connected in parallel, thereby increasing the total output current of the RBS.
However, conflicts may arise between the SPs of different batteries. 
For instance, the SPs of two batteries might form a short-circuit RBS structure, which is not allowed. 
To address this issue, a greedy algorithm incorporates as many SPs as possible while satisfying the reconstruction requirements.

The algorithm (see pseudo-code in Algorithm 1) is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:flowchart} and is summarized as follows:
First, the SPs are obtained by using Eqs. (\ref{eq:weight}) and (\ref{eq:def_sp}) in conjunction with the Dijkstra search. 
Next, the matrix $\bm{A}$ is calculated using Eq. (\ref{eq:A}), and the initial $N_{\text{set}}$ is set to $N_b$. 
The algorithm uses a dichotomy method to iteratively check until convergence different combinations of $c_b$ batteries from $N_b$ and updates $N_{\text{set}}$. 
For each combination, the algorithm constructs an effective solution if possible and calculates the currents $I_o$ and $\bm{I}_b$ by using Eqs. (\ref{eq:I_o}) and (\ref{eq:I_b}). 
If the maximum current $\bm{I}_b$ is less than or equal to $I_m$, $\eta$ is calculated by using Eq. (\ref{eq:eta}), and the maximum $\eta$ is updated accordingly. 
Finally, the algorithm outputs the maximum $\eta$ once $N_{\text{set}}$ converges.

\end{figure}

Currently, two types of RBS structures have been proposed by Visairo et al. \cite{visairoReconfigurableBatteryPack2008} and Lawson et al. \cite{lawsonSoftwareConfigurableBattery2012}, both of which have seen real use. 
The primary goal of Visairo's structure (Fig. \ref{fig:study-stru-Visairo}) is to dynamically adjust the RBS output power. However, the isolation of unhealthy batteries is not sufficiently addressed in their work. 
Lawson et al. designed the RBS structure shown in Fig. \ref{fig:study-stru-Lawson} to isolate batteries. 
Although this structure easily isolates batteries, it cannot dynamically adjust the output current of the RBS. 
Based on the structures of Visairo and Lawson, this paper proposes the structure shown in Fig. \ref{fig:study-stru-my}.
By integrating the Visairo RBS structure into the Lawson RBS structure, the proposed structure not only has the flexibility to switch the batteries between series, parallel, and mixed series-parallel modes but also allows the isolation of highly degraded batteries from the RBS.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{These four-battery RBS structures are investigated in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 


\DIFadd{In }\DIFaddend the case study, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{including the scenarios with random isolated batteries.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{these RBS systems are investigated and compared: (a) three different structures (Figs. \ref{fig:study-stru-Lawson}--\ref{fig:study-stru-my}) with the same four batteries; (b) the same structure in Figs. \ref{fig:study-stru-my} with two/four/six batteries; and (c) the four-battery structure in Figs. \ref{fig:study-stru-my} with random isolated batteries. 
The greedy algorithm proposed in this work is also compared with the brute-force algorithm, SA, and GA to validate its effectiveness and efficiency.
In order to adapt the two heuristic algorithms to the system's structure and scale, the number of the state neighbours of SA and the population size of GA are both set to $N_b \cdot N_s$, which increase with the number of batteries and switches in the system. 
The other algorithms' parameters are shown in Tab. \ref{tab:algorithm-parameter}.

\subsection{Discussion}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Consider first the results }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{\DIFadd{correctness of the results}}

\DIFadd{The correctness of the outcomes provided by the proposed greedy algorithm will be discussed from two perspectives: circuit analysis and validation against the brute-force algorithm. 
Let's take the four-battery RBS structure }\DIFaddend shown in Fig. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{fig:study-results-my} and listed in Tab.
\ref{tab:study-results-my}.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{fig:study-stru-my} as an example.
}\DIFaddend When $B_1$ and $B_2$ or $B_3$ and $B_4$ are connected in parallel, the RBS \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{outputs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{produces }\DIFaddend the maximum current, which is $\eta=2$ (i.e., twice the current output of a single battery in the RBS). 
Adding more batteries to the main circuit only \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{forms }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{creates }\DIFaddend a series structure and does not improve the MAC. 
Therefore, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{state of the switches given }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{switch-control scheme provided }\DIFaddend in Tab. \ref{tab:study-results-my} maximizes the RBS output current.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{On the other hand, the }\DIFaddend brute-force method, which \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{go through }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{examines }\DIFaddend all possible switch states, also \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{gives the same result.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{yields the same $\eta$.
This indicates that the proposed greedy algorithm successfully identifies the MAC among all the potential reconfigured structures.
}\DIFaddend 

%DIF < <*reviewer1-comment4>
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The literature contains no report on an algorithm for calculating the MAC of an RBS.
The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{\DIFadd{advantages and disadvantages of our method}}

\DIFadd{The proposed greedy algorithm possesses a significant advantage in terms of its effectiveness and efficiency. 
In this paper, it is compared with the }\DIFaddend brute-force algorithm, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{which goes through }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{SA, and GA. 
While the brute-force algorithm ensures the correctness of the results by exploring }\DIFaddend all possible switch states, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is the most straightforward way to determine the MAC and is used as a benchmark for the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{it comes at a high computational cost. 
The SA and GA are commonly used heuristic algorithms for addressing NP-hard problems. 
They selectively generate solutions for the switching states to maximize the objective value $\eta$.
However, neither of these two algorithms can determine whether the current $\eta$ represents the final MAC or if they should continue searching for better solutions. 
Moreover, as depicted in Figs. \ref{fig:e4-alg}--\ref{fig:e2f2-alg} and Figs. \ref{fig:e2f1-alg}--\ref{fig:e2f3-alg}, the SA and GA algorithms require more iterations to converge to the final solution compared to the }\DIFaddend proposed greedy algorithm. 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In contrast, the proposed greedy algorithm can identify the correct MAC in a shorter number of steps.
}


\DIFadd{To further elaborate on the efficiency of our algorithm, we analyze the time complexity of both the brute-force algorithm and the greedy algorithm.
}\DIFaddend If an RBS has $N_b$ batteries and $N_s$ switches and the corresponding directed graph has $N$ nodes,  $2^{N_s}$ iterations are required to traverse all reconfigured structures.
Calculating each reconfigured structure using Eqs. (\ref{eq:I_o})--(\ref{eq:eta}) requires matrix inversion and matrix multiplication, which has a time complexity of $O(N^3+2N^2N_b+N^2N_s+NN^2_b)$.
Therefore, the time complexity of the brute-force algorithm is $O\bm((N^3+2N^2N_b+N^2N_s+NN^2_b)2^{N_s}\bm)$.
The greedy algorithm proposed in this paper requires  that SP be found for each battery, which requires $N_b$ iterations.
Each SP can be obtained by several applications of Dijkstra's algorithms.
Therefore, the total time complexity for calculating all SPs is $O\bm(N_b(N_b+2N_s)\log_{10} N\bm)$.
According to  Appendix \ref{alg:greedy}, the RBS can reconfigure $C^{N_{\text{set}}}_{N_b}$ structures by selecting $N_{\text{set}}$ batteries from $N_b$ batteries, which gives $\sum^{N_b}_{N_{\text{set}}=1}C^{N_{\text{set}}}_{N_b}/N_b \approx 2^{N_b} N_b^{-1}$ on average.
Thus, with the bisection method, the time complexity of the greedy algorithm is $O\bm((N^3+2N^2N_b+N^2N_s+NN^2_b) 2^{N_b} N_b^{-1} \log_{10} N_b+N_b(N_b+2N_s)\log_{10} N\bm)$.
Based on currently proposed RBS structures \cite{ciNovelDesignAdaptive2007,alahmadBatterySwitchArray2008,kimDependableEfficientScalable2010b,kimBalancedReconfigurationStorage2011a,taesickimSeriesconnectedSelfreconfigurableMulticell2012a,6843711}, the number $N_b$ of batteries, $N_s$ of switches, and $N$ of nodes are quantitatively related as follows: $N_s \approx (3\text{--} 5)N_b$, $N \approx N_s$. 
After simplifying, the time complexity of the method with greedy algorithm is $O(2^{N_b}N_s^2\log_{10} N_b)$, while it is $O(2^{N_s}N_s^3)$ for the method with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{brute force }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{brute-force }\DIFaddend algorithm.
Therefore, as the RBS grows, especially in the number of switches, the greedy algorithm gains an advantage over the brute-force algorithm.
This is confirmed by the number of structures required to determine the MAC in the previous section. 
Compared with the brute-force algorithm, the method based on the greedy algorithm is 3\,000 to 48\,000 times more efficient, which is theoretically $N_s 2^{N_s - N_b} \log_{10} N_b$ times according to the above time-complexity analysis.
This benefits from two key points:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(1)] The SPs guide the RBS to reconfigure reasonable structures rather than blindly going through all possible structures. This reduces the complexity from $2^{N_s}$ to $2^{N_b}$, which is the main reason for the improvement in efficiency. 
    \item[(2)] The bisection method further accelerates this process, reducing the complexity from $2^{N_b}$ to $2^{N_b} N_B^{-1} \log_{10} N_b$.
\end{enumerate}

%DIF < <*reviewer1-comment5>
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{However, the greedy algorithm proposed in this paper still contains }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 


\DIFadd{Furthermore, this approach has the capability to handle RBSs with arbitrary structures, which is another significant advantage of it. 
It is able to correctly calculate the MACs of RBSs with arbitrary structures, even when they have different variant batteries, or even random isolated batteries. 
Theoretically, each RBS structure can be transformed into the unique directed graph model using the methodology described in the Section II, and the MAC can subsequently be calculated using the proposed greedy algorithm.
This finding has been supported in the previous subsection. 
}


\DIFadd{However, the suggested greedy algorithm still includes }\DIFaddend exponential terms in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{its }\DIFaddend time complexity, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{which means it may not be able to handle extremely large RBS structures having large $N_b$.
%DIF < </reviewer1-comment5>
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{indicating that it struggles to perform at scale. 
Additionally, all batteries are assumed to be identical for the sake of simplification in the derivation.
However, there may exist a small balancing current, which could introduce a minor bias to the MAC, due to variations in open-circuit voltage $u_b$ and internal resistance $r_b$ in reality.
Nevertheless, the proposed greedy algorithm remains a viable choice for the RBS design and optimization in the early stage, and the issue of balancing current bias can be addressed by considering the variations in batteries and replacing the internal resistance with impedance when constructing the directed graph model.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{\DIFadd{application scenarios}}

\DIFaddend Note that $\eta$ is used as the objective function instead of $I_o$ in solving for the MAC. 
This choice makes the resulting MAC more reasonable \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and applicable in practical scenarios}\DIFaddend . 
As shown in Tab. \ref{tab:study-results-my}, $I_o$ and $\bm{I}_b$ are functions of $R_o$, $u_b$, and $r_b$. 
However, when $I_o$ is used as the objective function, even for the same RBS structure, the MAC solution and corresponding switch states could change due to different external electrical appliances.
This would increase the difficulty and uncertainty of designing the RBS structure. 
To eliminate this problem, the ratio \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\eta=I_o/\max\bm{I}_b$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\eta=I_o/\max(\bm{I}_b)$ }\DIFaddend is adopted as the objective function in our research.
Recall that $\eta$ reflects only the structure's ability to output current, rather than the actual current outputing by the battery system.
Assuming that the MAC of batteries in the RBS is $I_m$, the maximum output current of the RBS structure can be calculated as $\eta I_m$ by determining the value of $\eta$ for the structure. 


The method proposed in this paper facilitates the design of RBSs in the following ways:
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Most }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{most }\DIFaddend currently proposed RBS structures \cite{ciNovelDesignAdaptive2007,alahmadBatterySwitchArray2008,kimDependableEfficientScalable2010b,kimBalancedReconfigurationStorage2011a,taesickimSeriesconnectedSelfreconfigurableMulticell2012a,6843711} have simple topological characteristics, so calculating the MACs is relatively straightforward, even intuitive.
However, these simple structures do not always fully satisfy the requirements of complex applications, such as dynamically adapting the circuit to variable and random operating conditions or actively equalizing differences between batteries in the RBS.
Moreover, isolating the batteries disrupts the original regularity and symmetry of the topology, which complicates the otherwise simple structure, and the maximum output current of the system becomes more challenging to obtain.
In contrast, the proposed method calculates the MAC of arbitrary RBS structures, notably the complex and flexible RBS structures.


To illustrate this point, the MACs of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{three RBS structures mentioned above }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the RBS structure in Fig. \ref{fig:study-stru-my} }\DIFaddend are calculated after isolating one or more of the batteries, as shown in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Tab. \ref{tab:isolated_mac}. 
Specifically, for the structure presented in Fig. \ref{fig:study-stru-my}, the corresponding circuit states for the MACs when isolating one to three batteries are depicted in }\DIFdelend Figs. \ref{fig:my-isolated-1}--\ref{fig:my-isolated-3}. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This structure has two cases in which two }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{When a single battery is isolated, the RBS is still capable of outputting the maximum current, denoted as $\eta=2$.
When two }\DIFaddend batteries are isolated\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, there are two scenarios}\DIFaddend : 
one is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to isolate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{isolating }\DIFaddend two batteries within the same substructure (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Fig. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Figure }\DIFaddend \ref{fig:my-isolated-2b}), \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in which case }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{resulting in }\DIFaddend $\eta=2$; the other is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to isolate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{isolating }\DIFaddend one battery in each of the two substructures (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Fig. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Figure }\DIFaddend \ref{fig:my-isolated-2w}), \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in which case }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{resulting in }\DIFaddend $\eta=1$. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The results in Figs. \ref{fig:my-isolated-1}--\ref{fig:my-isolated-3} show that the proposed method provides reasonable outcomes for isolating any number of batteries in any position.
Furthermore, the output current for the three RBSs with isolated batteries is also shown in Tab. \ref{tab:isolated_mac}. 
For the structure proposed by Lawson et al., the MAC is independent of the number of isolated batteries.
However, for Visairo's structure, the MAC decreases upon increasing the number of isolated batteries. 
Nevertheless, the MAC of the structure proposed in this work falls between the MACs of these two structures. 
This result indicates that the structure proposed in this paper has a larger MAC than Lawson's for the same number of batteriesand has a wider range of regulation of the output current}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{If three batteries are isolated, the RBS can only output the current of a single battery, which is $\eta=1$.
Therefore, the battery management system can adjust the output current and control the RBS to reconfigure the corresponding structure based on the isolated batteries}\DIFaddend .


\section{Conclusion}

This paper proposes a pervasive and automated method to efficiently compute the MAC of an RBS.
The method is implemented by a greedy algorithm combined with an improved directed graph model.
Not only does the method provides the same global MAC calculation results as the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{brute force }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{brute-force }\DIFaddend method, but it also \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{improves the calculation efficiency by 3\,000 to 48\,000 times for three RBS structures in the case study}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{demonstrates superior computational efficiency compared to both the brute-force algorithm and the heuristic algorithms (SA and GA)}\DIFaddend . 
Theoretically, for an RBS with $N_s$ switches and $N_b$ batteries, the efficiency of the proposed method is $N_s 2^{N_s - N_b} \log_{10} N_b$ times that of the brute-force method\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, which is mainly because of using }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. 
This is primarily due to the utilization of }\DIFaddend the batteries' SPs to guide the RBS to reconfigure reasonable structures rather than blindly going through all possible structures.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The main }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Another }\DIFaddend advantage of this method is its \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ability }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{capability }\DIFaddend to calculate the MAC of RBSs with arbitrary structures \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and variant batteries}\DIFaddend . 
Even in scenarios with random isolated batteries, the proposed method remains effective.
This method \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{helps to fully tap the current output potential }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{facilitates the full utilization }\DIFaddend of the RBS\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, guide the RBS structure }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'s current output potential, guides the }\DIFaddend design and optimization \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of the RBS structure during the }\DIFaddend design stage, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{assist }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{assists }\DIFaddend in evaluating the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{current-overload risk of the system }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{risk of current overload }\DIFaddend in practical applications.
